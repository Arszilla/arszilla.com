<h1>
    About
</h1>

<p>
    I am a mathematics undergraduate with a programming and security background. I am experienced in running small 
    teams and large communities. Since 2019, I've been involved in information security, and become an avid CTF 
    player while working towards my OSCP certification. Although I mainly focus on penetration testing, I have 
    interests in expanding my skill set to include cyber threat intelligence, malware analysis, and OSINT.

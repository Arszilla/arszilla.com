<h1>
    About
</h1>

<p>
    I am a mathematics graduate with a programming and security background. Since 2019, I have been involved in 
    information security, and become an avid CTF player     while working towards my OSCP certification at the time. 
    At the same time, I worked with Offensive Security and Kali Team in order to develop and publish Kali i3-gaps. 
    Although I mainly focus on penetration testing, I have interests in expanding my skill set to include cyber threat 
    intelligence, malware analysis, and OSINT.
